Above are the list of dependencies used in this project.Reason for using these dependencies is to make the project more scalable and maintainable for future use.Also these dependencies are used to make the project initialization and deployment process easier with less effort and time for given requirements.

Reason to chose mongodb as a database is because it is a NoSQL database which is a scalable and easy to use database for this type of application. which not require complex queries to be written.

As for alternatives i would consider use  python flask framework for backend service.


## Future Plans

Add user role and permission management.
https exception handling to generate proper response.
add field validation using joi.
